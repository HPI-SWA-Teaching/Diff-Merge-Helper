(name 'ToolBuilder-Kernel-ar.18'message '- integrate http://bugs.impara.de/view.php?id=55220005522: ToolBuilderSpec help support restricted to tree, menu item, and button specs.Only PluggableMenuItemSpec, PluggableTreeSpec, and PluggableButtonSpec classes have a instvar #help with accessors and corresponding buildWith: handler method that provide help-text rendering. This should be generalized to any element and rendered wherever possible.Attached is a suggested changeset for refactoring the instvar and accessors up to the generic ToolBuilderSpec class, as well as adding a generic handler for setting the balloon text for Morphic UI specs. I cannot say how well this will work for Tweak, but I imagine it is not difficult.'id 'eee7c28a-63c7-d546-a9db-eb7a0041cc8b'date '26 November 2006'time '4:19:23 pm'author 'ar'ancestors ((id '101a0378-c42e-4ffc-a7a3-679c88f66ee4'))stepChildren ())
