(name 'ToolBuilder-Kernel-dtl.57'message 'Fix Debugger in MVCChanges to Tools, System, ST80, Morphic, and ToolBuilder-Kernel to restore Debugger operation in MVC. Resolves several issues introduced in the Squeak 3.9 time frame. Add ToolBuilder>>openDebugger:label:closing: to specify a topLevel to close when transitioning from debug notifier to the debugger. This enables the transition from a debug notifier to the full debug window. MVC closes views and controllers in a rather specific order, and #openDebugger:label: was not sufficient to implement this properly.Fix some errors in earlier Project refactorings that were causing a debugger in MVC to call a method to restart the (Morphic) UI process when interrupting the UI process. This resulted in two active controller processes running in MVC after resuming from a debugger. The spawnNewProcessIfThisIsUI: method is moved to the instance side of Project and becomes a no-op for an MVC project. Class side methods are retained to protect for possible references from external projects.'id '2c93dc70-c1a7-4ac2-89fb-8dad390f0c4e'date '9 July 2013'time '7:43:25.464 pm'author 'dtl'ancestors ((id '31af859c-9e28-4086-8353-36c8d53ef0d4'))stepChildren ())
