(name 'ToolBuilder-Kernel-dtl.46'message 'A Project has a UIManager, and a UIManager has a ToolBuilder, so add #toolBuilder ivar to UIManager and initialize accordingly. This facilitates setting up the appropriate UIManager and ToolBuilder to allow SMxMorphicProject to host a SimpleMorphic world.Change Toolbuilder class>>default to always ask the default UI manager for its tool builder. Remove class var Default (this was provided in the ToolBuilder package but never used in Squeak). Deprecate ToolBuilder class>>default:Background: In previous Squeak usage, ToolBuilder class>>default always invoked a search for the appropriate ToolBuilder subclass, and class var Default was unused (this is awkward if more than one kind of ToolBuilder could be used in a project that #isMorphic). This change makes the default tool builder an explicit attibute of the active UI manager.'id '5a2e8628-078c-4aed-a441-b9f9fb844e32'date '5 March 2011'time '1:05:35.352 pm'author 'dtl'ancestors ((id 'e818b263-f3cf-4da2-a087-1c6543b891f6'))stepChildren ())
