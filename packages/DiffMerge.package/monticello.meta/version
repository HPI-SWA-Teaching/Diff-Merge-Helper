The problem was in the way file2indices was being processed: if we''d been traversing it in reverse, the way Hunt&McIlroy reported Szymanski did it, everything would have been fine, but to optimise away the creation of "redundant" candidates, we needed to be more careful about not reexamining entries too far down in the list of candidates. Switching from use of #findCandidateFrom:forLine: to #findCandidateFrom:forLine:startingAt: fixed the problem. There was also an order-of-operations bug where I had failed to take note of the "simultaneously perform" part of step 4 in Hun&McIlroy''s description of the "merge" step.' id '99be3e4c-3090-4ce6-a5c9-0bccba97f727' date '29 July 2011' time '1:13:29.075 pm' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.11' message 'Add failing test case from Levente.' id '706f3795-7c54-473c-b9b6-86b5109c0916' date '11 January 2010' time '2:43:33 pm' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.10' message 'Rename local variable to avoid conflict with instance variable of the same name.' id '573a1a5a-0510-4234-9f2a-fd39cfaee364' date '11 January 2010' time '1:47:12 pm' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-ul.9' message '- fix a recently introduced bug in MyersUkkonenDiff' id '7686f9ad-886a-e540-a604-20cc3ee8a266' date '6 January 2010' time '6:03:15 am' author 'ul' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-ul.8' message '- optimize space usage in MyersUkkonenDiff- implement missing #subclassResponsibility' id '271e2770-746a-6b4f-ad06-400d67ab02b9' date '6 January 2010' time '5:03:03 am' author 'ul' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-ul.7' message '- added another diff algorithm (from squeak trunk)- refactored the tests' id '5ad0a2f7-24b3-8743-a7cd-f9a627dc97dd' date '6 January 2010' time '3:56:11 am' author 'ul' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-ul.6' message '- added another diff algorithm (from squeak trunk)- refactored the tests' id 'eaaf6c7b-e8c8-ff44-a1c8-1baf723a8664' date '6 January 2010' time '3:50:51 am' author 'ul' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.5' message 'Fix a bug where trailing non-common regions were not being processed by comm and diff.' id '5a38f608-597b-488b-9d8f-c9b5917b813b' date '9 August 2008' time '12:34:35 pm' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.4' message 'Comments.' id '5e8984d5-5179-4a80-821d-12cc3527d7fe' date '17 June 2008' time '1:38:39 am' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.3' message 'Implement Diff3ExclusiveVisitor.' id '61da57ae-41af-446c-adec-f693686e82a2' date '17 June 2008' time '12:46:02 am' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.2' message 'Fix tests' id '02630eba-efee-4194-9123-8255520283c5' date '17 June 2008' time '12:35:04 am' author 'tonyg' ancestors ((name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.1' message 'Initial checkin' id '151db89a-41cc-4adf-97fc-5cafe5568f8d' date '17 June 2008' time '12:23:59 am' author 'tonyg' ancestors () stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())(name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.6' message 'Copy test cases from synchrotron; fix bugs thus exposed.
