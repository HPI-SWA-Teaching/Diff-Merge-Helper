(name 'DiffMerge-tonyg.12'message 'Fix a bug reported long ago by Levente Uzonyi. The problem was in the way file2indices was being processed: if we''d been traversing it in reverse, the way Hunt&McIlroy reported Szymanski did it, everything would have been fine, but to optimise away the creation of "redundant" candidates, we needed to be more careful about not reexamining entries too far down in the list of candidates. Switching from use of #findCandidateFrom:forLine: to #findCandidateFrom:forLine:startingAt: fixed the problem. There was also an order-of-operations bug where I had failed to take note of the "simultaneously perform" part of step 4 in Hun&McIlroy''s description of the "merge" step.'id '99be3e4c-3090-4ce6-a5c9-0bccba97f727'date '29 July 2011'time '1:13:29.075 pm'author 'tonyg'ancestors ((id '706f3795-7c54-473c-b9b6-86b5109c0916'))stepChildren ())
