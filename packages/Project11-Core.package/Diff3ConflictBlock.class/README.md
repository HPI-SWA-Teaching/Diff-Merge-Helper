I am representing a conflicting block of a Diff3Merge.
I know if I am solved due to user interaction (choosing remote, local or ancestor version or defining a customized string).
I also know if I am a clean conflict, i.e. if my local and remote code snippets are equal, but the ancestor was something different.
